          <p class="card-text">The first artifact I've included is my planner.
            It may seem a bit boring, but it represents an important accomplishment 
            for me: staying organized. As a freshman, I've been getting a lot of 
            advice about how to succeed in college - and planning and organization
            has been central to the vast majority of this advice. Keeping a planner
            has also pushed me to reflect on how I spend my time. How do I finish
            all of my assignments on time without sacrificing depth of engagement
            with the material? To how many activities can I commit myself? It's a
            balancing act that I look forward to improving as I continue on my 
            college journey.

          <h5 class="card-title">Community Outreach</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            This fall, I joined the High School Events branch of Community Outreach
            in the Society of Women Engineers at UW. This is the title slide of
            our first presentation, an event that helped high school students
            learn about different engineering majors. The event helped me realize
            that I am passionate about outreach - this is an area with which I 
            would love to engage more. It was also a challenging moment, however, 
            since attendance at the event was not up to our goal. Our team took 
            this setback as an opportunity to improve our schedule for promoting events, 
            and I know this first event will remain an inspiration for me in the future.

            been around UW this fall: a UW logo face mask. This is not an artifact
            that is unique to me - and that is what makes it so significant.
