              It may seem a bit boring, but it represents an important accomplishment 
              for me: staying organized. As a freshman, I've been getting a lot of 
              advice about how to succeed in college - and planning and organization
              has been central to the vast majority of this advice. Keeping a planner
              has also pushed me to reflect on how I spend my time. How do I finish
              all of my assignments on time without sacrificing depth of engagement
              with the material? To how many activities can I commit myself? It's a
              balancing act that I look forward to improving as I continue on my 
              college journey.

              This fall, I joined the High School Events branch of Community Outreach
              in the Society of Women Engineers at UW. This is the title slide of
              our first presentation, an event that helped high school students
              learn about different engineering majors. The event helped me realize
              that I am passionate about outreach - this is an area with which I 
              would love to engage more. It was also a challenging moment, however, 
              since attendance at the event was not up to our goal. Our team took 
              this setback as an opportunity to improve our schedule for promoting events, 
              and I know this first event will remain an inspiration for me in the future.

              It represents my responsibility to my community, and reminds me
              of the recent Global Challenges discussion, which demonstrated the interdisciplinary
              nature of communicating about crises. Throughout the pandemic, I've 
              had a lot of time to reflect on how we unite communities around a
              common goal, such as reducing the spread of coronavirus. This
              reflection elicits broad questions:
              What can we learn about communicating to the public in general from
              the UW's response to the pandemic? How can we continue to improve our
              response, and how can we apply effective communication strategies 
              in areas outside of pandemic response?

              This is my first pull request, an update to code on a GitHub repository,
              for my Experiential Learning research. It not only represents my 
              first contribution to the project, but the learning process that 
              led up to it. I learned new syntax and new concepts, and I refined
              my debugging strategies. When I pushed my code to the respository,
              I was proud of what I'd accomplished and excited
              to accomplish more.

            <p class="card-text">
              This artifact is a compilation of slides from the Explore Engineering
              Conference, an event I did with SWE High School Events. It was an 
              event for which I had a big role - we had 16 volunteer presenters
              for the event, and, as the Speaker Coordinator, I was responsible
              for finding and communicating with these presenters.

              It was inspiring to see the result of all my work and planning throughout 
              the quarter, especially since students were involved and excited to
              ask questions. 

              At the start of the year, I never would have thought I could hold
              so much responsibility for such a large event, or that I could
              accomplish what I did this quarter. But I did, and now I am
              encouraged to get even more involved.

              This is a section of the point totals for a problem set I did in 312.
              It was the worst grade I had received on an assignment thus far.
              Though I was initially disappointed, I remembered all the advice
              students and professors had given me: a bad grade is a learning experience,
              not a reflection of who you are as a person. The grade was a reminder
              that my main focus was learning and understanding the material,
              not just completing assignments and worrying about point totals.
              I focused more on preparing and studying for problem sets and went to office
              hours for the first time in the quarter. Though it was stressful,
              I'm glad that I had this experience - the quarter overall was challenging,
              but it was the one in which I grew the most and it was the most rewarding.

      <h2>Experiential Learning: Storage Management Research</h2>
      <p>This quarter, I participated in my first experiential learning activity.
        I worked with a graduate student in the UW Database Group on TASM, a tile-based
        storage manager for video analytics. Essentially, it provides a faster way
        to store and access videos that are labeled with object information by splitting
        videos into tiles (spatial subsets) based on the location of objects within the frames.

      <p>Below are my original application for the experience and my final reflection.
